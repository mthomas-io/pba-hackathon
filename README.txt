# StakeHouse (Polkadot Lottery Liquid Staking)

> StakeHouse is a liquid staking protocol built on Polkadot using PVM smart contracts that rewards stakers with periodic lottery entries instead of just static yield. Users deposit DOT (or other native assets), receive a liquid derivative token (like stDOT), and are automatically entered into weekly draws where one or more winners receive the pooled rewards. This gamified model boosts engagement and encourages long-term staking.

**Problem:**
Traditional staking has fixed, often small, returns. Many users arenâ€™t excited to stake unless APY is high.

**Solution:**
A lottery-based model gives people upsized reward potential with the same low-risk staking mechanics.

**Proof it works:**
PoolTogether (on Ethereum) proved the model with ~$90M deposited at peak.
